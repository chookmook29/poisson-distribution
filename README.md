# poisson-distribution

Old fun project of mine. This script checks if [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) works in the world of football. It calculates future chances of many different results based on past statistics of given home and away team. A lot of different scenarios are considered and given percentage chance of occuring.
